### Adding a Dataset to an R Package

**Steps**

  1. Go to the GitHub Repo, in `moderndive` repo `data-raw/DD_vs_SB.csv`
  
    + `data+raw/` is a directory, `DD_vs_SB.csv` is the raw data from the web that we put in that directory
    
    + i.e. in spirit of transparency and reproducibility, share raw-ist form of data
    
  2. In repo, `data-raw/process_data_sets.R` (Line 99) is a reprex (reproducible example) to clean/wrangle data (Line 101-118) and add data to package via `usethis::use_data()` (Line 119)
  
    + use `overwrite = TRUE` generally to make sure people only access the most updated dataset, when putting it in the first time, `overwrite = TRUE` will just create it
    
    + `usethis::use_data()` created `data/DD_vs_SB.rda` file (compressed R data file), which is what gets distributed 
      
      - you never interact with this file, it's only used internally in R
  
  3. In repo `R/datasets.R` for documenting data set using `roxygen2` code.
  
    + `R/` contains all functions and roxygen documentation code
    
    + Line 244 - 258 is the code for the help file, `@format` you give each variable context
    
    + This creates the output `man/DD_vs_SB.Rd` which is a R help file that you shouldnâ€™t directly modify. Leave it alone. To make changes, change the `roxygen` code. 
    
      - `man/` is the [instruction] manual directory and `.Rd` is an R documentation file
