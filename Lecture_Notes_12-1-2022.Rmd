## Lec 23

### Vignettes 

A `README` cover page is a quick start guide to the package, but a vignette is a detailed instructional manual. 

```{r}
## to access a list of all vignettes available for all packages

vignette()

## to access the specific vignette for ggplot2

vignette("ggplot2-in-packages")
```

You can only see the vignettes of packages you have installed. 

```{r}
## get the name of the vignette for IPEDS package

vignette(package = "IPEDS")
vignete ("IPEDS-vignette")

```

roxygen makes it easy to write vignettes with the `usethis::use_vignette()` wrapper function. But you need to configure your build tools to make sure that you can use roxygen for this.
