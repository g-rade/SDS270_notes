### GitHub Actions, Continuous Integration

Continuous integration is a software engineering tool for automating routine tasks. Outsource these tasks to the machines. 

GitHub Actions is GitHub's implementation of CI. In our case, we'll automate package checking with every pushed commit. But you can do lots of stuff with GitHub Actions. 

`usethis::use_github_actions()` to add the automatic check to your repository. 
`usethis::use_github_actions_badge()` to add the CMD check to your README.
